# Vision Zero Citizen Research and Analysis Project
See this [Medium article](https://jackturek.medium.com/vision-zero-is-a-great-idea-can-it-work-in-the-us-part-1-6075ef45914d) for an intro to what this project is all about!

## How we work
Our work is tracked in the GitHub project [Vision Zero Research and Analysis](https://github.com/users/JTurek708/projects/2/views/1). We copied the latest Vision Zero cities list (Aug 2022) and expanded it into a dataset in Google Sheets that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_NtzL4gpi_JaPgO0PwGO87RV7Ex_6HZw7PwTuMMzp9c/edit#gid=0).
